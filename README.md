# RT-Engine-LR90

## Overview
RT-Engine-LR90 is a lightweight, efficient ray tracing engine built in Java. It supports basic geometric shapes, shadows, and lighting to render realistic 3D scenes.

## Features
- **Ray Tracing**: Core ray tracing algorithm to render 3D scenes.
- **Lighting**: Supports point light sources for realistic shading.
- **Shadows**: Calculates shadows for objects in the scene.
- **Geometric Shapes**: Supports spheres, with plans for more shapes.
- **Camera**: Configurable camera to view the scene from different angles.

## Installation
